<p><span style="font-size: 24px;">﻿</span><span style="font-size: 24px;">A lot of people claim to create designs that resonate with the user mentality but I believe </span><u><span style="font-size: 24px;">every user looks at a design with a unique perspective and there’s no set pattern</span></u><span style="font-size: 24px;">.</span></p><span style="font-size: 24px;">
</span><p><span style="font-size: 24px;">As a designer with 3+ years of experience, </span><u><span style="font-size: 24px;">I’ve observed users of different ages and worked with unique sets of brands</span></u><span style="font-size: 24px;">. My solution is more of a holistic approach and that is to </span><u><span style="font-size: 24px;">provide the user exactly what they’re here for, nothing less or nothing more</span></u><span style="font-size: 24px;">.</span></p><span style="font-size: 24px;">
</span><p><span style="font-size: 24px;">People have an attention span of less than 5 sec while looking at a design and my goal is to make them explore so that they keep coming for more.</span></p>
